# Spectrum [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jason-neal/Spectrum.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jason-neal/Spectrum)

Learn to use Classes by creating a Spectrum class to use in my Phd work.


Ideas to include:

Variables pixel, flux, wavelength

Spectral slicing method. (wav_selector)

Radial velocity shifts

Wavelength calibration method. pixel->wavelength

Spectral subtraction:  SpectrumA - SpectrumB

Spectral division    SpectrumA/SpectrumB 



## Other Spectrum Classes:

There are many other spectrum classes around but None (sofar) that overload the operators

I will list them here as I find them 
- https://github.com/crawfordsm/specreduce
- https://github.com/crawfordsm/pyspectrograph/tree/master/PySpectrograph/Spectra
- http://pyspeckit.bitbucket.org/html/sphinx/spectrum.html#pyspeckit.spectrum.classes.Spectrum
- https://github.com/cokelaer/spectrum

Wow A lot. I probably should not reinvent the wheel too much then...
