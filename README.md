# spectrum_overload [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jason-neal/spectrum_overload.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jason-neal/spectrum_overload) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jason-neal/spectrum_overload/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/jason-neal/spectrum_overload?branch=develop)

## Overview
The purpose of this was project was to learn how to use and create Classes, and to create a Spectrum object to use within my Phd work.

The main goals of this project are basically complete.

- create a class to contain spectrum
- automatic interpolation 
- overloaded operators
especially
- Spectral division (SpectrumA / SpectrumB )
- Spectral subtraction (SpectrumA - SpectrumB)
- Powers/exponents (Spectrum ** x)

## Installation
Currently to install and use Spectrum class for your own projects.

clone the git repository where you want it:
  
    https://github.com/jason-neal/spectrum_overload.git

cd into the downloaded directory:

    cd spectrum_overload

and install using:

    python setup.py install





There are many other spectrum classes around but None (sofar) that overload the operators
## Other Spectrum Classes

There are many other spectrum classes around but I didn't see any that overload the operators. (I could be blind).

One of these may better suit your needs

I will list them here as I find them 
- https://github.com/crawfordsm/specreduce
- https://github.com/crawfordsm/pyspectrograph/tree/master/PySpectrograph/Spectra
- http://pyspeckit.bitbucket.org/html/sphinx/spectrum.html#pyspeckit.spectrum.classes.Spectrum

Wow A lot. I probably should not reinvent the wheel too much then...
