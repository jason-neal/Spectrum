# Spectrum
Learn to use Classes by creating a Spectrum class to use in my Phd work.


Ideas to include:

Variables pixel, flux, wavelength

Spectral slicing method. (wav_selector)

Radial velocity shifts

Wavelength calibration method. pixel->wavelength

Spectral subtraction:  SpectrumA - SpectrumB

Spectral division    SpectrumA/SpectrumB
