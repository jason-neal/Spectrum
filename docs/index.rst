Spectrum_overload is to manipulate astronomical spectra in a spectrum class with :ref:`overloaded operators <overloaded_operators>`.
This means that you can easily divide and subtract spectra from each other using the math operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``**`` keeping the wavelength, flux and headers together.

Other Projects
===============
There are many other packages that deal with spectra, none that I know of overload the operators.

In alphabetical order:

    - `astropy/specutils <https://github.com/astropy/specutils>`_
    - `cokelaer/spectrum <https://github.com/cokelaer/spectrum>`_
    - `crawfordsm/specreduce <https://github.com/crawfordsm/specreduce>`_
    - `pyspeckit/spectrum <https://github.com/pyspeckit/pyspeckit/tree/master/pyspeckit/spectrum>`_
    - `PySpectrograph/Spectra <https://github.com/crawfordsm/pyspectrograph/tree/master/PySpectrograph/Spectra>`_

I am sure there will be more to add here.


Contributions
=============
Any contributions and/or suggestions to improve this module are very welcome.

Submit `issues <https://github.com/jason-neal/spectrum_overload/issues>`_, suggestions or pull requests to `jason-neal/spectrum_overload <https://github.com/jason-neal/spectrum_overload>`_.

This is my first attempt at creating classes, and packaging a python project so any *helpful* feedback is appreciated.
